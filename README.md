# SAP1 Proteus Project

## Overview

This project involves running an SAP1 simulation in Proteus and generating a hex file to be used in the simulation. The hex file is then loaded into RAM, and the project is executed.
## 
- Proteus software installed on your computer.
- Hex file generator tool.
- Basic understanding of Proteus and SAP1 simulations.

## 
- `proteus_project`: Contains the Proteus simulation files.
- `hex_generator`: Contains the hex file generator tool.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Generate the Hex File

1. Download & Open the hex file generator.
2. Follow the instructions in the tool to generate the hex file.
3. Save the generated hex file to a known location on your computer.

### Step 2: Load the Hex File into Proteus

1. Open Proteus and load the SAP1 project.
2. In Proteus, go to the RAM component where you need to load the hex file.
3. Paste the location of the generated hex file into the RAM component settings.

### Step 3: Run the SAP1 Project

1. Ensure that the hex file is correctly loaded into the RAM component.
2. Start the simulation in Proteus.
3. Monitor the simulation and verify that the SAP1 project is running as expected.
